// Frame - Data structure that holds execution-relevant information. Short for "call frame" or "stack frame"
// and sometimes "activation record". On real machines a frame is not something separate from, but a designated
// part of "the stack". It's where the return address, the arguments to the current function, and it's local
// variables are stored. In VM land we don't have to use the stack. We're not constrained by standardized
// calling conventions and other much too real things, like real memory addresses and locations. Since we can
// store frames anywhere we like. What's kept on the stack and what's not differs from VM to VM. Some keep
// everything on the stack, others only the return address, some only the local variables, some the local
// variables and the arguments of the function call. The implementation depends on the language being
// implemented, the requirements in regards to concurrency and performance, the host language, and more.
// We are choosing the way that is easiest to build, understand, extend, etc.

	closure     *object.Closure

}

// pointer to -1, and returns a pointer to the frame.
